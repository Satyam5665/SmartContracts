# * E-Commerce Smart Contract
I have used Solidity as a Programming Language to write this Smart Contract.I have created this contract for an Ecommerce website such as Amazon where the seller will first 
add the product to the list using registerProduct() function , then buyer will first pay the money to the contract for the product he buys and when the product is delivered to him 
he can confirm this using the delivered() function .After he confirms the delivery the money will be transferred to the seller.
 <br /> I created this contract on remix.ide and then deployed it on Rinkeby Test Network.
